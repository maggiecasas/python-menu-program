Cruise Line Menu Program

This project was created as part of Lab 2 for the course Business Application Programming at Florida International University FIU).
The goal of this lab is to practice Python fundamentals such as variable naming, print statements, and string methods.

What it does:
- Stores menu information for two types of meals: Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian
- Tracks each menu’s appetizer, entrée, and dessert with their calorie counts
- Calculates total and average calories for each menu
- Displays all results neatly formatted using both comma operators and f-strings

How to run:
1. Download the file casasnovas_lab2.py
2. Open a terminal or IDE and run: python casasnovas_lab2.py
3. The program will print both menus and show total and average calories for each

Example output:

Vegetarian menu  
Appetizer - Olive plate - 200  
Entree - Risotto with steamed vegetables - 470  
Dessert - Fruit tart - 265
